# password-generator
Password generator using different character choices

# Selecting Criteria
I set up the password generator according to the acceptance criteria.  

You can choose only one of the four character sets but the generator will show a message if nothing is selected.

I also added the criteria of 8-128 character length with an alert which will show if the inputted value is outside of this range and the generator will not run

# Using the Generator
The generator is simple to use.  One click on the generate button and then a series of prompts will be displayed.

If the prompts are answered in accordance with the selection criteria then the generator will run and the password will be displayed on the screen.

The generator can be run as many times as the user likes.  The passwords are not stored.
